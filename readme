when we first start working with gpus, we quickly become concerned with
    how do i get some code to run on it?
    how is this code interacting with the gpu?

suppose we want to execute some code path on the gpu
    we refer to this action as an invocation
    this invocation may not necessarily be independent
    this invocation may be mapped to multiple lanes
    or to independent threads
    it may not guarantee forward progress at every time step
we must be aware of possible constraints before making assumptions on its behavior

*we will assume userspace, and using existing API*
